		<descr><![CDATA[Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite.&lt;br/&gt;
			This enables you to plug your laptop or computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being shared.&lt;br/&gt;
			In addition it supports some nifty things that have never been seen elsewhere like correct mDNS reflection across LAN segments.&lt;br/&gt;
			Compatible technology is found in Apple MacOS X (branded â€‹Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf).]]></descr>

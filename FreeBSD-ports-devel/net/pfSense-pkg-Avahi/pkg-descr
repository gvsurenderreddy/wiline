Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the
mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite.<br/>
			This enables you to plug your laptop or computer into a
			network and instantly be able to view other people who
			you can chat with, find printers to print to or find
			files being shared.<br/> In addition it supports some
			nifty things that have never been seen elsewhere like
			correct mDNS reflection across LAN segments.<br/>
			Compatible technology is found in Apple MacOS X (branded
			Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf).
